## web_scrapping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:
* Job Title
* Company of Name
* Location
* Job Description
* Salary Estimate
* Rating
* Company Size
* Type of Ownership
* Sector
* Company Founded Date
* Industry
* Revenue
